# Logistic-Regression-with-Python

This repository demonstrates Logistic Regression concepts through hands-on examples.  
It contains simple, practical notebooks showing training, regularization, multiclass strategies, hyperparameter tuning, feature scaling, and dealing with imbalanced classes.

## Contents
- Theory: logistic vs linear, sigmoid, regularization, evaluation metrics
- Practical examples: training, L2 regularization, multiclass (OVR), GridSearchCV tuning
- Feature scaling comparisons and best practices for imbalanced datasets

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib

## How to run
Open the notebook in Google Colab and run cells sequentially. The code uses standard sklearn datasets and is reproducible.
